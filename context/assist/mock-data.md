We need a single source of truth for mock data to use for the catalog UI until we implement a database. Read @context/project-overview.md and look at @context/screenshots/list-product.png to see the data structure.

Create a new file at frontend/src/lib/mock-data.ts and create a simple data structure for the dashboard UI. It should include items, collections, item types and a user for the current logged in user. Do not make this too complex. It is only for displaying data in the dashboard like the screenshot. Do not create helper methods, just a simple data file to import.
